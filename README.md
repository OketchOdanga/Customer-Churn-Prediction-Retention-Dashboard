# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction & Retention Dashboard

This project is a complete machine learning pipeline designed to **predict bank customer churn** and generate actionable **retention strategies**. It also includes a rich, interactive **dashboard** for customer analytics and SHAP-based explainability.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies. This project:

- Trains an XGBoost model to predict churn.
- Generates a churn probability score for each customer.
- Recommends personalized retention actions.
- Explains individual predictions using SHAP.
- Displays an interactive dashboard with filters, insights, and SHAP visualizations.

## 🏗️ Project Phases

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Data loading, cleaning, feature selection, and model training |
| **Phase 2** | Churn prediction, scoring customers, and saving results |
| **Phase 3** | Generating retention strategy per customer |
| **Phase 4** | SHAP analysis for global and individual prediction explanations |
| **Phase 5** | Streamlit dashboard for filtering, visualizing churn patterns, and inspecting individual customers |

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-dashboard.git
cd churn-dashboard
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Prepare your data**

Use the `Churn Bank Dataset` in CSV format with columns like:
`CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember, EstimatedSalary, Exited`

Place it in: `data/raw/churn_bank.csv`

5. **Run scripts step-by-step**

```bash
# Phase 1 - Train and save model
python scripts/train_model.py

# Phase 2 - Score customers
python scripts/score_customers.py

# Phase 3 - Generate retention plan
python scripts/generate_retention_plan.py

# Phase 4 - Compute SHAP values
python scripts/compute_shap.py
```

6. **Run the Streamlit dashboard**

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/dashboard.py
```

## 🎯 Retention Strategy Logic

Based on churn probability and balance:

| Condition                   | Action                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Churn > 0.7 & Balance > 50K | Assign Personal Banker |
| Churn > 0.7                 | Offer Retention Bonus  |
| Churn > 0.5                 | Send Engagement Email  |
| Otherwise                   | No Action Needed       |

---

## ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Libraries: `xgboost`, `shap`, `pandas`, `streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`

---

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Deploy the dashboard with Streamlit Cloud or HuggingFace Spaces
* Add customer segmentation with clustering
* Enable email notifications for high-churn-risk customers
* Integrate voice support for real-time customer service tools
* Connect to live databases or CRM systems
